# Helping Hands RL Environments
- [License](https://github.com/ColinKohler/helping_hands_rl_envs/blob/master/LICENSE)

This package contains various simulated robotics environments used for research in the [Helping Hands](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) lab.
The majority of these environments entail a robotic arm armed with a paralel jaw gripper executing a series of manipulation based tasks. For a full list of 
the tasks currently implemented see below. The core simulator used for most tasks is [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) but a simple numpy
based simulator is included for quick prototyping.

- **pyramid_stacking**: TODO
- **house_building_1**: Build a house structure with a block stack and a small triangle roof on top.
- **house_building_2**: Build a house structure with two block bases and a large triangle roof.
- **house_building_3**: Build a house structure with two block bases, one brick in the middle, and a large triangle roof.
- **house_building_4**: Build a house structure with two block bases, one brick in the second layer, two blocks in the third layer, and a large triangle roof.
