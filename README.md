# Helping Hands RL Environments 
This repository holds the various environments use to train different RL algorithms. At the moment 
these environments are primarily focused around pick and place tasks of varying difficulty levels.
In addition, there are currently two different simulators used for these environments: V-REP and 
PyBullet.

# Environments
- **BlockPicking:** Pick up a block on a table. Block size and initial pose are stochastic.
- **BlockStacking:** Pick up blocks and place them in a stack. Block size and initial pose are 
                     stochastic.
- **DiskStacking:** Pick up disks and place them in a stack. Disk size and initial pose are 
                    stochastic.
- **StairStacking:** Pick up blocks and place them in a stair-like configuration. Inital block 
                     pose is stochastic.

# Simulators
You can use any of the simulators to run these environments depending on your overall goals. Below
are brief descriptions of the different simulators and their tradeoffs.
