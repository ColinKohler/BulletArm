NOTES:
  - To start out we are just going to use vision + force (i.e. no proprioception)
    + This is mainly b/c I don't know if adding it to the transformer will cause issues
    + We could potentially explore adding this back in later if desired

Done:
  - Runner: Deals w/ray and logging
  - SharedStorage: Deals with passing information b/t ray threads
  - Agent: Mostly just changed action sampling to use latent space
  - DataGenerator: I don't think this needs to change
    + This just calls BulletArm and the Agent to get observations
    + Might need to update this alongside ReplayBuffer if we need to do some weird stuff here

TODO:
  - ReplayBuffer: Need to add/modify sampling to work w/latent model training
  - Trainer:
